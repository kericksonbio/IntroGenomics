# Week 6- Plotting in R

We're again drawing some of this material from the STEMinist_R materials
which can be found [here](https://github.com/ecalfee/STEMinist_R.git)

We will also be talking a lot about figures and how to make and
interpret figures in the lecture slides here: [Week 6
Slides](./figs/W6_Figures.pdf))

## Main Objectives

-   Learn how to subset dataframes and how to use logicals
-   Learn how to make various plots in R, including histograms,
    scatterplots and boxplots, as well as learn how to customize those
    plots
-   Learn useful commands in R including points(), lines(), abline(),
    hist(), boxplot() and plot() -Learn how to use arguments within
    plot(): main, xlab, ylab, col, pch, cex

Start by making a new R script titled `Week 6- plotting` so that you can
follow along with today's code! We will again work with the sleep
dataset on sleep patterns in mammals. This requires installing a package
(ggplot2) and loading the data (msleep). This dataset includes
information about mammal sleep times and weights that was taken from a
study by V. M. Savage and G. B. West. "A quantitative, theoretical
framework for understanding mammalian sleep. Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, 104 (3):1051-1056, 2007."

The data includes `name` (common name), `genus`, `vore` (carnivore,
omnivore, etc), `order`, `conservation` (status), `sleep_total` (total
amount of sleep in hours), `sleep_rem` (rem sleep in hours),
`sleep_cycle` (length of sleep cycle, in hours), `awake` (amount of time
spent awake, in hours), `brainwt` (brain weight in kilograms) and
`bodywt` (body weight in kilograms).

```{r, echo=T}

library(ggplot2)
data(msleep)
```

## Subsetting datasets & logicals

A few useful commands: equals `==`, does not equal `!=`, greater than
`>`, less than `<`, and `&`, and a pipe which can also indicate "and"
`|`.

Reminder there are two assignment operators in R `<-` and a single
equals sign `=`. The one you use really depends on how you learned to
use R, and are otherwise equivalent.

**Logical conditions vs. assignment operators:**

Logical values of TRUE and FALSE are special in R. What class is a
logical value?

```{r, echo=T}
TRUE
FALSE

# what class is a logical value?

class(TRUE)

```

Logical values are stored as 0 for FALSE and 1 for TRUE. Which means you
can do math with them!

```{r, echo=T}

TRUE + 1
FALSE + 1

sum(c(TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE))

!TRUE

!c(TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE)
```

Logicals will be the output of various tests:

```{r, echo=T}

1 == 1
1 == 2

 # does not equal

1 != 1
1 != 2

 # greater than

1 > 1
1 >= 1

 # less than

1 < 3

 # combining logical conditions with and (&), or(|)

1 == 1 & 2 == 2
1 == 1 & 1 == 2
1 == 1 | 1 == 2
 
 # we can take the opposite of a logical by using !

!TRUE
```

This is very useful because we can use logicals to query a data frame or
vector.

```{r, echo=T}

# in our msleep data frame, which species have total sleep greater than  or equal to 18 hours?

msleep[,"sleep_total"]>=18

# Using which() to identify which rows match the logical values (TRUE) and length to count how many species there are

which(msleep[,"sleep_total"]>=18)  #20 22 37 43 62 --> the rows that contain organisms that sleep more than 18 hrs

length(which(msleep[,"sleep_total"]>=18)) #5 --> number of species that sleep more than 18 hrs 

 # which four species are these?

msleep[which(msleep[,"sleep_total"]>=18),]
``` 
Looks like our species include North American opossum, big brown bats, thick-tailed opposums, little brown bats and giant armadillos. What if we only want to see the bats that sleep more than 18 hours per 24 hour period?

```{r, echo=T}
msleep[which(msleep[,"sleep_total"]>=18 & msleep[,"order"] == "Chiroptera"),] #should give us two species!

```

> ## Class Exercise 1

> Let's keep looking at the mammal sleep data! 
>
> - Q1. How many mammals sleep 6 hours or less total? Of these species, how many are marine mammals (in the order Cetacea)?
>

## Plotting in Base R

### Scatterplots

First let's work on building a scatterplot. This can be a good first
step for visualizing data and is the base plotting visualization in R.

```{r, label='6', echo=T}

plot(msleep$sleep_total~msleep$sleep_rem)

# or plot response variable as a function "~" of the predictor variable
```

```{r,  label='6-0', echo=T}

plot(msleep$sleep_rem~msleep$sleep_total) #you'll notice this swaps the x and y axis

```

> #### X vs Y
>
> When thinking about how to plot the x and y axes on a graph, it is
> important to think about the research question and which variable is
> the independent vs dependent variable. Our graph will show us how y
> changes with x, so we want the x axis to represent the independent
> variable and the y axis will be the dependent variable. In our graph,
> we are interested in how rem sleep in mammals changes with the total
> amount of sleep they get, so we will want the second graph, where
> `sleep_total` is on the x (dependent variable) and `sleep_rem` is on
> the y (independent variable). Review the lecture slides again if this
> gets confusing in the homework!

-   There are several different arguments within plotting functions that
    can be used to customize your plot.
-   `col` changes color
-   `pch` changes point character
-   `cex` changes size
-   `type` changes type ("l" = line, "p" = points, "b" = both)
-   `lty` changes line type
-   `bty` changes (or removes) the border around the plot ("n" = no box,
    "7" = top + right, "L" = bottom+left, "C" top+left+bottom, "U" =
    left+bottom+right)

You can view different point characters with `?pch`

There are **many** color options in R. For some general colors you can
write the name (blue, red, green, etc). There are apparently 657 named
colors in R (including "slateblue3, and peachpuff4) but you can also use
the color hexidecimal code for a given color. There are several
comprehensives guides for colors in R online and one of which can be
found
(here)[<https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/2020-04/colorPaletteCheatsheet.pdf>]

Let's remake the total_sleep against sleep_rem plot and add-in some
modifiers

```{r,  label='6-1', echo=T}
#Choose a pch and make the color blue and give it a bottom+left border
plot(msleep$sleep_rem~msleep$sleep_total, pch = 16, col="blue", bty="L")

```

We can change the axes and title labels using "xlab", "ylab", and "main"
arguments. Let's add labels to our plot.

```{r, label='6-2', echo=T}
#Choose a pch and make the color blue and give it a bottom+left border
plot(msleep$sleep_rem~msleep$sleep_total, pch = 16, col="blue", bty="L", xlab="REM Sleep (hours)", ylab= "Total Sleep (hours)") 

```

You may want to find out which points are on a plot. You can use
`identify()` in place of `plot()` to identify specific points within
your plot. This function prints out the row numbers for the points that
you selected.

We can also add lines to an existing plot with `ablines()`. Let's add a
line fit from a linear model to our plot.

```{r, label='6-3', echo=T}
#first make a plot
plot(msleep$sleep_rem~msleep$sleep_total, pch = 16, col="blue", bty="L", xlab="REM Sleep (hours)", ylab= "Total Sleep (hours)") 

#then add a line. The function lm runs a linear model on our x, y values.
abline(lm(msleep$sleep_rem~msleep$sleep_total))

```

You can add a legend to a plot with `legend()` which needs you to
specify the location.

To do this, let's make a cutoff for our points and color them by points
above and below the cutoff. We'll use our subsetting skills from last
week. Feel free to review that section (1.3).

```{r, echo=T}
#start by defining points by whether they are greater than sleep_total 16 and storing
#first make a empty column named colors within the msleep dataframe

msleep$colors=NA
#store the colors "red" or "black" in the color column for the rows that satsify the following criteria.
msleep$colors[msleep$sleep_total >= 17] <-"maroon"
msleep$colors[msleep$sleep_total < 17] <-"darkgreen"
```

```{r, label='6-4', echo=T}
plot(msleep$sleep_rem~msleep$sleep_total, pch = 16, col=msleep$colors, bty="L", xlab="REM Sleep (hours)", ylab= "Total Sleep (hours)") 

        
```

### Histograms

In addition to scatterplots you can make histograms and boxplots in base
R. The same parameter options (pch, col, ylab, xlab, etc) apply for
these plots as well as scatterplots.

R will automatically plot a barplot if you give to the `plot()` function
a continuous variable and a factor. If you have a vector stored as a
character converting it to a factor via `as.factor` will make a boxplot.

```{r, label='6-5', echo=T}

#let's make a histogram of sleep_total and fill it with the color palette rainbow() which needs to know how many colors to use

hist(msleep$sleep_total, col=rainbow(10))


#let's make a boxplot of sleep_total and order making eachone a different color (how would you find out how many unique orders are in msleep?)
#using plot
#plot(msleep$sleep_total~as.factor(msleep$order), col=rainbow(19)) #this is commented out simply to avoid ploting the same plot twice
```

```{r, label='6-6', echo=T}
#or boxplot
boxplot(msleep$sleep_total~as.factor(msleep$order), col=rainbow(19)) 

```

Another example looking at sleep variation across the different types of
consumers (carnivore, herbivore, insectivore and omnivore):

```{r,label='6-7', echo=T}
plot(msleep$sleep_total~as.factor(msleep$vore),col=rainbow(4), xlab="REM Sleep (hours)", ylab= "Total Sleep (hours)")
```

data("ChickWeight")

## Plotting with ggplot2

GGPlot is a package that allows you to make a lot of different kinds of
plots and has become increasingly popular. There are also many tutorials
on how to use ggplot as well as example code that could be modified to
fit the data you're interested in plotting. There is a really helpful
cheatsheat
(here)[<https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf>]

There is a little bit of a learning curve for ggplot as the syntax is
structured differently than base R plotting. One thing that remains the
same and is even more noticible in ggplot is the iterative process of
building a plot, one aspect at a time.

Let's demonstrate what ggplot can do with this dataset on the Effect of
Vitamin C on Tooth Growth in Guinea Pigs. You can also open your dataset
with this command which pulls it into a different window with `View()`

```{r, echo=T}
#load in the data
data(ToothGrowth)
#look at the structure of the data
str(ToothGrowth)

```

This dataset has three columns, `len` for length of tooth, `supp` for
supplement provided, either OJ or VC, and `dose` for amount of the
supplement given. OJ was orange juice and VC was abcorbic acid, and they
wanted to test how these two delivery methods may change tooth growth,
as well as the different doses. Two of our variables are categorical
(`supp` and `dose`) while tooth length is continuous. What type of data
you are working with is important when we think about how to visualize
our data.

If you do the command `ggplot(data=ToothGrowth)` you will just see a
grey box. In order to tell ggplot what to put in the box we use the
`aes()`. The `aes()` function stands for aesthetics and will be used to
specify our axes and how we want the data grouped.

Since we have two categories, dose or supplement, and one continuous
variable that we want to see how it varies by those categorical
variables, let's try to plot the amount of tooth growth with the
supplement given to the guinea pigs.

```{r, label= '6-8', echo=T}
#we specify which axes we want to be x and y with aes()
#we'll then use geom_point to tell it to make a scatterplot 
#using the data we specified in the first command
ggplot(data=ToothGrowth, aes(x=supp, y=len))+geom_point() 

```

This scatterplot visualization isn't super useful since there are only
two supplement types, OJ and VC, and the points for tooth length are
just spread across the Y axis. A boxplot would likely be the best way to
visualize this data, so let's try that!

There are many types of plots in ggplot that can be called with `geom_`
including `geom_line`, `geom_boxplot` `geom_bar` and many others!

```{r,label= '6-9', echo=T}
#we specify which axes we want to be x and y with aes()
ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(y=len, x=supp))+ geom_boxplot()

```

What if we want to add color to make the two supplements even more
distinguishable from one another?

```{r,  label= '6-10',  echo=T}
#same graph but add color!
ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(y=len, x=supp, fill= supp))+ geom_boxplot()

```

These are the base formats for plots in ggplot2, so it can be fun to
customize the theme, colorscheme etc to make your graphs more specific
to your work and easier to interpret. I like to change the background
from grey to white so that it is less distracting from the data. All of
these things can be modified if we wish. Many of these options can
easily be changed with the `theme_` functions.

Let's change to a minimal theme which removes the gray background in the
back of the plot. Play around with the other themes to see what they
change. You can change colors with RcolorBrewer again with
`scale_fill_brewer()` or `scale_fill_manual()` to choose the two colors.
The `values=c()` part is important when you are using two or more
colors!

```{r,  label= '6-11',  echo=T}
#change the theme
ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(y=len, x=supp, fill= supp))+ geom_boxplot() + scale_fill_manual(values=c("darkorange", "lightpink"))+ theme_minimal()

```

Now let's look at the `msleep` dataset again with `view()` and make a
plot of total sleep against REM sleep and then group by "vore". Load the
data with the command below:

```{r, echo=T}
data(msleep)
```

Because `vore` is a character vector we will need to convert it to a
factor for ggplot to be able to use it as a group or a color. This can
be easily done with `as.factor()`.

```{r, label= '6-12', echo=T}
# because our vore vector is a character vector we must convert it to a factor before we can use it to group or color
ggplot(msleep, aes(y=sleep_rem, x=sleep_total, group=as.factor(vore), color=as.factor(vore))) +geom_point() +theme_minimal()

```

If you use `View()` to look at our dataset you will see there are some
NAs in our `vore` column which may give you a warning when you go to
plot since there is missing data. That looks fine, but we may want to
add axis labels and change the legend. The code below does just that and
changes the theme.

```{r,label= '6-13', echo=T}
# as we add things to the plot the line can get really long, you can hit enter after the plus sign to start a new line

ggplot(msleep, aes(y=sleep_rem, x=sleep_total, group=as.factor(vore), color=as.factor(vore)))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(y= "Total Sleep (hours)", x= "REM sleep (hours)")+
  theme_minimal()+
  scale_color_manual(name="Diet", 
                        labels = c("Carnivore", 
                                   "Herbivore", 
                                   "Insectivore", 
                                   "Omnivore", 
                                    "NA"), 
                        values = c("carni"="pink", 
                                   "herbi"="darkgreen", 
                                   "insecti"="orange", 
                                   "omni"="brown", 
                                   "NA"="grey"))

```

Our plot at this point is getting very clunky. You can assign what we
have so far to an object and continue to add parameters without having
to copy and paste the whole plot. This can also be useful for saving
your plots as images for powerpoint presentations with `ggsave()`. This
will save a photo of your figure on your desktop!

```{r, label= '6-14', echo=T}
#assign to an object

plot1<-ggplot(msleep, aes(y=sleep_rem, x=sleep_total, group=as.factor(vore), color=as.factor(vore)))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(y= "Total Sleep (hours)", x= "REM sleep (hours)")+
  theme_minimal()+
  scale_color_manual(name="Diet", 
                        labels = c("Carnivore", 
                                   "Herbivore", 
                                   "Insectivore", 
                                   "Omnivore", 
                                    "NA"), 
                        values = c("carni"="pink", 
                                   "herbi"="darkgreen", 
                                   "insecti"="orange", 
                                   "omni"="brown", 
                                   "NA"="grey"))

plot1

ggsave("plot1.png",plot1, width=20, height=20, units = "cm") 
```

I use ggplot often with data sets that have multiple character vectors
and I want to see how they relate to my continuous variables. For
example in the iris dataframe we may be interested in looking at the
relationship between Sepal.Length and Sepal.Width for each species. This
dataset was published by Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper: "The use of
multiple measurements in taxonomic problems". It has three plant species
(setosa, virginica, versicolor) and four morphological traits measured
for each sample in centimeters: Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length
and Petal.Width. As I have mentioned before, it is important to acknowledge that the field of genetics has been built on eugenics, and Fisher (author of this dataset) was a prominent geneticist and eugenicist. More information about this can be accessedhere:
<https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/gee/ucl-centre-computational-biology/ronald-aylmer-fisher-1890-1962>

![Iris Diagram for Reference](./figs/iris.png)

```{r, echo=T}
data(iris)
```

```{r, label= '6-15',  echo=T}
ggplot(iris, aes(y=Sepal.Length, x=Sepal.Width, group=Species, color=Species))+
  geom_point() + theme_minimal()
```

If you want to add a line of best fit to each population you can do that
with `geom_smooth()`

```{r, echo=T, warning=TRUE, label='6-16'}
ggplot(iris, aes(y=Sepal.Length, x=Sepal.Width, group=Species, color=Species))+
  geom_point()+ geom_smooth(method="lm") +theme_minimal()

```

Finally, if you want to look at each species on it's own graph at once
you can look at all of these together with `facet_wrap` or `facet_grid`.

```{r,   label= '6-17',  echo=T}
ggplot(iris, aes(y=Sepal.Length, x=Sepal.Width, group=Species, color=Species))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~Species)+
  geom_smooth(method="lm") +theme_minimal()

```

> ## Class Exercise 3

> Go back to the Guinea Pig Tooth Dataset (ToothGrowth) and visualize
> how the different doses of VC and OJ impact tooth growth. Use
> `facet_wrap()` and plot the doses of the treatments within each graph,
> with three separate graphs for each dose (0.5, 1 and 2)
> data(ToothGrowth)

```{r, label= '6-22', echo=T}
ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(y=len, x=supp, fill= supp))+ geom_boxplot() + facet_wrap(~dose)+ scale_fill_manual(values=c("darkorange", "lightpink"))+ theme_minimal()
```

Plotting the mean values with error bars for several groups can also be
useful for data visualization. You can use the function `stat_summary`
to find the mean and error around that mean for the given grouping.

Now let's look again at the Chick Weight dataset! Here's a plot looking
at the mean chickweight by diet.

```{r, label= '6-18',  echo=T}
ggplot(ChickWeight, aes(x=Time, y=weight, group=Diet, color=Diet))+
  stat_summary(fun=mean, geom="point", size=1)+
  stat_summary(fun=mean, geom="line", linewidth=1)+
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_se, geom = "errorbar", 
               aes(width=0.1), linewidth=0.5) +theme_minimal()

```

## For loops and the apply family of functions

A few useful commands: function(), is.na, which, var, length, for(){ },
points, print, paste, plot, unique, sample

for loops: In many languages, the best way to repeat a calculation is to
use a for-loop: For example, we could square each number 1 to 10

```{r, echo=T}
squares = rep(NA, 10) # use rep to create a vector length 10 of NAs to store the result
for (i in 1:10) { # for loop
  squares[i] = i^2
}
squares

```

## Group Work Activity: Palmer Penguins!

![Artwork by](./figs/lter_penguins.png) For this week's activity we will
be working with the dataset `palmerpenguins`
<https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/> First install the
package with the data. There are two datasets, `penguins` and
`penguins_raw`. Learn more about each dataset by doing `?penguins` or
`?penguins_raw` in your console. We will be working with the `penguins`
dataset for the homework.

Use `install.packages("palmerpenguins")` To download the data. It might
take a second to download! After it is downloaded check it is there and
prepare the dataset:

```{r, echo=T}
library(palmerpenguins)
data(package = 'palmerpenguins')
```

For this week your goal is to do the following:

1)  Without using the `view()` command, report the names of the unique
    species in this dataset and how many species there are.

2)  Using the `penguins` dataset, how does bill length vary across the
    three species? Consider the best way to visualize this figure, is a
    scatterplot or a boxplot a better fit for showing the variation
    between the species? **Interpret the main takeaway from this figure
    in one to two sentences.**

3)  Again using the `penguins` dataset visualize the relationship
    between bill length and bill depth across the three species. This
    should all be in one single graph with a specific color and a line
    of best fit for each of the species. **Interpret the main takeaway
    from this figure in one to two sentences.**

Copy the lines in your script used to answer all three of these
questions into your canvas submission. Be sure to include the answers
for question 1, interpretations for the figures and the two figures you
made as well.

## Key Points

-   Subsetting data is an important part of data exploration

-   Making plots in R can be really fun, but is important to think about
    your audience and what you want your plot to convey when making it!
    For example, scatterplots and boxplots are useful for visualizing
    different types of data.

-   You can plot in base R or ggplot, but ggplot can give you more room
    to customize your figures to your liking
